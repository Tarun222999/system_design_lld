Observer Pattern Requirement Idea: Live Cricket Score Alerts

Goal
Build a notification system where users subscribe to a live cricket match and receive updates whenever key match events happen.

Domain Story
- A match object (publisher/subject) maintains live state: score, wickets, overs, and match status.
- Different user apps (subscribers/observers) want updates in different ways.
- When a major event occurs, all registered subscribers are notified.

















Core Requirements
1. Create a Subject interface with methods:
   - addSubscriber(Subscriber subscriber)
   - removeSubscriber(Subscriber subscriber)
   - notifySubscribers()

2. Create an Observer interface with one method:
   - update(MatchEvent event)

3. Implement a concrete subject `CricketMatch` that stores:
   - matchId
   - team names
   - current score summary
   - list of subscribers

4. Define a `MatchEvent` model containing:
   - eventType (SCORE_UPDATE, WICKET, OVER_COMPLETE, INNINGS_END, MATCH_END)
   - message
   - timestamp
   - optional score fields

5. Implement at least 3 concrete subscribers:
   - MobilePushSubscriber
   - EmailSubscriber
   - CommentaryConsoleSubscriber

6. Notification rule:
   - notifySubscribers() should be triggered only for major events (wicket, over complete, innings end, match end).
   - minor ball-by-ball events should not notify all subscribers.

7. Runtime behavior:
   - Subscribers can be added/removed while match is in progress.
   - Removed subscribers must stop receiving updates immediately.

8. Demo in Main:
   - Create one match.
   - Register multiple subscribers.
   - Publish a sequence of events.
   - Remove one subscriber mid-way.
   - Continue events and show only active subscribers receive updates.

Optional Extensions
- Let subscribers choose event preferences (e.g., only wickets + match end).
- Add throttling for email subscribers.
- Add a second match to show independent publisher instances.

Acceptance Criteria
- Observer pattern roles are clearly separated.
- No concrete subscriber logic is hardcoded inside `CricketMatch`.
- Adding a new subscriber type should not require changing subject logic.
