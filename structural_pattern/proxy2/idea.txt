Proxy Pattern Requirement Idea: Document Access Control

Goal
Design a document viewing system where access to sensitive documents is controlled through a proxy.

Scenario
Users request documents by ID. Some documents are public, some are confidential.
Direct access to the real document service should be blocked.
All requests must go through a proxy that performs checks before delegating.

Requirements
1. Create subject interface `DocumentService` with:
   - String getDocument(String documentId, String userRole)

2. Create real subject `RealDocumentService`:
   - Stores document content in memory (Map)
   - Returns content if called
   - Does not perform access validation itself

3. Create proxy `DocumentServiceProxy`:
   - Implements `DocumentService`
   - Holds reference to `RealDocumentService`
   - Enforces access rules before forwarding call

4. Access rules:
- `PUBLIC_*` documents: accessible by all roles
- `CONFIDENTIAL_*` documents: accessible only by `ADMIN` and `LEGAL`
- Unauthorized access should return: "Access denied for <role> on <documentId>"

5. Extra proxy responsibilities:
- Add simple request logging (who requested what)
- Add basic caching for successful public document reads

6. Main demo flow:
- Employee reads public doc (allowed)
- Employee reads confidential doc (denied)
- Admin reads confidential doc (allowed)
- Repeat public read to show cache usage

Acceptance Criteria
- Client talks only to proxy, not directly to real service
- Access logic is centralized in proxy
- Real service remains focused on data retrieval
- New validation rules can be added without changing client code
