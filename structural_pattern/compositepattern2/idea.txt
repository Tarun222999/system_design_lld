Composite Pattern Requirement Idea: File System Explorer

Goal
Design a file-system model where files and folders are treated uniformly through a common interface.

Scenario
You need to represent:
- Files (leaf nodes)
- Folders (composite nodes)
A folder can contain files and subfolders.
Operations should work recursively on nested structures.

Requirements
1. Create a common component interface `FileSystemComponent` with:
   - getName()
   - showDetails(String indent)
   - getSize()

2. Create leaf class `FileItem`:
   - stores file name and size
   - `showDetails` prints file info
   - `getSize` returns its own size

3. Create composite class `FolderItem`:
   - stores folder name and list of `FileSystemComponent`
   - methods: add(component), remove(component)
   - `showDetails` prints folder and recursively prints children
   - `getSize` returns sum of child sizes

4. Build a sample tree in Main:
- root/
  - docs/
    - resume.pdf
    - notes.txt
  - photos/
    - trip/
      - img1.jpg
      - img2.jpg
  - todo.txt

5. Demonstrate operations:
- print full hierarchy
- print total size of root
- print total size of a nested folder

Acceptance Criteria
- Client uses only `FileSystemComponent` reference for both files/folders.
- No type checks (`instanceof`) in client code.
- Adding a new component type should not break existing traversal logic.
