# Smart Home Mediator Idea

**Devices in the system:**
- Light
- Fan
- AC
- Alarm
- Door Lock

> Devices should **NOT** communicate directly with each other.

## Coordination Requirements
When certain events happen, the mediator must trigger coordinated actions:

- **Alarm is triggered:**
  - Turn on all lights
  - Lock all doors
  - Turn off AC

- **User leaves (home mode activated):**
  - Turn off lights
  - Turn off fan
  - Turn off AC
  - Lock doors

- **User enters (home mode):**
  - Unlock doors
  - Turn on lights

> Devices should not know:
> - Which other devices exist
> - What logic connects them

A central controller (mediator) should manage the coordination logic.


Constraints:
    Adding a new device (e.g., Heater) should not require modifying all other devices.
    Devices should only communicate through a central component.

What You Should Design:
    Device interface
    Concrete devices
    Central coordination component
    How events are handled
    How commands are triggered
