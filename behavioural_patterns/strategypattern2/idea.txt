STRATEGY PATTERN - DATA EXPORT SYSTEM
=====================================

SCENARIO:
Build a report generation system where users can export data in different formats
(CSV, PDF, JSON, Excel) without modifying the core exporter logic.

PROBLEM:
- Different export formats have different processing logic
- Adding new formats shouldn't require changing existing code
- The export logic should be interchangeable at runtime




















REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create an interface/strategy for export formats
2. Implement concrete export strategies:
   - CSVExporter: Exports data as CSV format
   - PDFExporter: Exports data as PDF format
   - JSONExporter: Exports data as JSON format
   - ExcelExporter: Exports data as Excel format

3. Create a ReportGenerator/Exporter class that:
   - Accepts an export strategy
   - Can switch strategies at runtime
   - Uses the strategy to export data

4. In Main class, demonstrate:
   - Creating different exporters
   - Switching export formats dynamically
   - Generating reports in different formats

BENEFITS:
- Easy to add new export formats without modifying existing code
- Runtime flexibility to change export format
- Each export strategy is independent
- Follows Open/Closed Principle
