there is a observer that will propogate the change to the subscribers


observer interface - this is the interace that reacts to the changes
concrete observer class - this implements the observer how we excatly notify the change
subject interface -the utubechannel needs to keep track of all its subscribers and notify
when something changes

concret subject class -implement subject interface



observer interface - subscriber
concrete observer - what each subscriber should be notified
subject interface publisher
concrete subject class - what each publisher should do 

A YouTube channel (subject) and subscribers (observers):

Subscribers register to the channel.
New video uploaded -> channel notifies all subscribers

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where:

One object (the Subject) holds state.
    Many objects (the Observers) want to know when that state changes.
    When state changes, the Subject notifies all observers automatically.
Core pieces
    Subject / Publisher
        Keeps a list of observers
        Methods like attach(), detach(), notifyObservers()
Observer / Subscriber
    Defines an update() method
    Gets called when the subject changes
Why use it
Decouples sender and receivers (subject doesn’t need to know observer internals)
Easy to add/remove listeners at runtime
Common in event systems, UI, notifications, stock price updates, etc.
