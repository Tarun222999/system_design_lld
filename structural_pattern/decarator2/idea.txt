Decorator Pattern Requirement Idea: Coffee Ordering System

Goal
Design a coffee billing system where add-ons are applied dynamically without changing base coffee classes.

Scenario
A cafe sells base drinks and optional add-ons.
Users can combine multiple add-ons in any order.
Final description and price should reflect all chosen add-ons.

Requirements
1. Create component interface `Coffee` with:
   - String getDescription()
   - double getCost()

2. Create concrete base coffees:
   - Espresso
   - Cappuccino
   - HouseBlend

3. Create abstract decorator `CoffeeDecorator`:
   - implements `Coffee`
   - stores wrapped `Coffee` object

4. Create concrete decorators (add-ons):
   - Milk
   - Sugar
   - Whip
   - Caramel
Each decorator should:
   - append its name to description
   - add its own price to cost

5. Main demo flow:
- Order 1: Espresso + Milk + Sugar
- Order 2: Cappuccino + Whip + Caramel + Milk
- Order 3: HouseBlend (no add-on)
Print description and total cost for each order.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add-ons are stackable at runtime.
- No subclass explosion like `EspressoWithMilkAndSugar`.
- Base coffee classes stay unchanged when new add-ons are introduced.
- New decorator can be added with minimal changes.
