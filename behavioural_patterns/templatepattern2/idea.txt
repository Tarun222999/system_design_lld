Template Method Pattern Idea: Report Generation System

Goal
Design a system to generate different types of reports (PDF, CSV, HTML) using a common processing pipeline.

Scenario
A reporting service always follows these steps:
1. fetchData()
2. validateData()
3. formatReport()
4. exportReport()
5. sendNotification() (optional hook)

Requirement
- Create an abstract class `ReportGenerator` with a final template method `generateReport()`.
- `generateReport()` should define the fixed algorithm order.
- Common steps can have default implementation in base class.
- `formatReport()` and `exportReport()` must be abstract and implemented by subclasses.
- Add a hook method `shouldNotify()` (default false); if true, call `sendNotification()`.

Concrete classes to implement
- `PdfReportGenerator`
- `CsvReportGenerator`
- `HtmlReportGenerator`

Main flow
- Create one object of each generator type.
- Call `generateReport()` for each.
- Show that algorithm order is fixed but formatting/export behavior changes.

Acceptance criteria
- No duplicated pipeline logic in subclasses.
- `generateReport()` cannot be overridden.
- Adding a new report type should require only a new subclass.
