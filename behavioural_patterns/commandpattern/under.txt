let say u have couple of actions -> club them into command 
use the command whenever required

commnd interface execute method
conrete command
reciever that does actually work
invoker (triggers command)


so there is a command interface + now there is implementation for this interface which purpose is to call a receiver where the real task desires now there is a invoker which uses the implementation to execute the reciever without knowing whats inside the reciever (filesystem class + openfile) is the task now we are wrapping it as command in OpenFileCommand  which can implemented in button that is elsewhere

Invoker (Button)
      ↓
Command (OpenFileCommand)
      ↓
Receiver (FileSystem)
