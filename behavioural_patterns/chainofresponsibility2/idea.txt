Chain of Responsibility Requirement Idea: Customer Support Ticket Escalation

Goal
Design a support ticket handling flow where each support level decides whether it can handle the request or pass it to the next handler.

Scenario
A ticket has:
- ticketId
- issueType (BILLING, TECHNICAL, ACCOUNT, SECURITY)
- severity (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- description

Support hierarchy:
1. L1Support
- Handles LOW severity general issues.
- Escalates others.

2. L2Support
- Handles MEDIUM severity technical/account issues.
- Escalates others.

3. Supervisor
- Handles HIGH severity (except security breach).
- Escalates CRITICAL/security breach.

4. SecurityTeam
- Handles all SECURITY and CRITICAL security tickets.

Requirements
1. Create a handler interface/abstract class with:
   - setNext(Handler next)
   - handle(Ticket ticket)

2. Each concrete handler must:
   - Decide whether it can handle the ticket.
   - If yes, process and print who handled it.
   - If no, forward to next handler.

3. If no handler can process a ticket:
   - Print "No handler available for ticket <id>".

4. Build chain in Main:
- L1 -> L2 -> Supervisor -> SecurityTeam

5. Demonstrate with sample tickets:
- one handled by L1
- one handled by L2
- one handled by Supervisor
- one handled by SecurityTeam
- one unhandled case

Acceptance Criteria
- Client code sends request only to chain head.
- No large if-else in Main for routing.
- New handler can be added with minimal changes.
