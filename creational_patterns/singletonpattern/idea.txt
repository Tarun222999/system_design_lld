Problem

Design a Configuration Manager for an application.

Requirements

- There should be only one instance of the configuration manager.
- It should load configuration values once.
- All parts of the application should access the same instance.
- It must be thread-safe.
- The configuration manager should expose this method:
  `String getValue(String key)`

Constraints

- Assume multiple threads may access it.
- You do not need to actually read from a file; mock config storage is fine.
